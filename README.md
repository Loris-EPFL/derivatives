For question 6: "Use your preferred language to write a code that computes the futures prices in a
VIX futures as a function of time to maturity, the current squared volatility Vt , and
the parameters (λ, θ, ξ) of the squared volatility process. Analyze numerically how
the result depends on the parameters (λ, θ, ξ).", 
you can find the code on VIX.py (futures formula) and vix_analysis.ipynb (run this notebook which calls the VIX file)

For question 7 : "Use your preferred language to write a code that computes the futures prices in
Variance futures as a function of time to maturity T − t, the accrued variance, the current squared volatility Vt , and the parameters (λ, θ, ξ) of
the squared volatility process. Analyze graphically how the result depends on the parameters (λ, θ, ξ).",
you can find the code on Variance.py (futures formula) and variance_analysis.ipynb (run this notebook which call the Variance file)

For question 8 : "Use the code you developed in the previous two questions together with the market
data in the excel file Fin404-2025-VIXnCo-Data to calibrate the current squared
volatility Vt and the parameters (λ, θ, ξ).", 
you can run the clibration_final.ipynb file (has all the data and functions inside it)
