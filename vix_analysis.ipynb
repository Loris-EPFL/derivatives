    "Why This Approach Makes Sense\n",
    "Time-homogeneous model: In our model, the stochastic process for the squared volatility $V_t$ is time-homogeneous, meaning its dynamics don't explicitly depend on calendar time. Only the time differences matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward-looking perspective: When pricing futures, we're interested in the time remaining until maturity, not the absolute calendar dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: By directly using T_t as a parameter, we avoid having to track two separate time variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we're at time $t=0$ (today) and want to price a futures contract maturing in 1 year, we would call:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "price = compute_vix_futures(T_t=1.0, Vt=0.04, lambda_=2.0, theta=0.04, xi=0.4)\n",
    "This is mathematically equivalent to computing $f^{VIX}_0(1)$ in the notation from the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing the term structure, we vary T_t to see how the price changes with different maturities, all from the perspective of the current time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yes, T_t is exactly equal to $T-t$ from the mathematical notation, and this approach is standard in financial modeling."
